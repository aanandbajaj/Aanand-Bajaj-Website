The history of the human species is incredible. We went from coming out of the cave for the first time to building gigantic cities. We went from this: 

To this: 

We went from building bows and arrows to hunt for food to building massive structures in space to explore the universe. 

As a species, we did all this in just a few thousand years, which is approximately a blip when it comes to the timeline of the Earth. To put this fact into perspective, if you "squish" the entire history of Earth into a calendar year, with January 1st being when the Earth was born and December 31st being today, human beings first walked the planet at 11:36 PM on December 31st. 

However, history also has a dark side. Throughout history, wars between humans have ravaged entire civilizations and societies. For centuries, philosophers and historians have tried to determine what drives this violent nature of humans that has been witnessed and recorded in the past. Some notorious examples of barbaric acts include medieval machines to torture humans, The Holocaust, and The Rwandan Genocide. 

The fact that these violent stories have persisted throughout history means that violence could be innate in human nature and worth examining. The questions I pondered were:

* Why is this even interesting? 
* Looking back at the data about human violence
* Why do humans commit these violent acts? 
* Has violence decreased overtime? 
* Is the fate of the human race sealed? Is the idea of "unity" appealing? 
* What are the implications for modern day society?

### Why is this an interesting topic to explore?
One of the reasons why exploring this topic is interesting is because of the speed at which humans can commit acts of gruesome violence. 

All of these events in history are always preceded by a "classification event" where groups of humans are formed. This can mean countries, societies, cultures, etc. In other words, before groups of humans become violent with each other, they develop "tribes." We see this everywhere, from capitalism vs. socialism, to democrats vs. republicans, to casteism, ordinary people joining ISIS, and so on.

### Let's look at the data
When you take a step back from the history books, you realize that the Medieval Ages and the Roman Empire wasn't exactly a time of Jousting and Shakespearean plays. Let's look at some statistics about war and violence over the past few hundred years:

* 	In the 1340s, the homicide rate was around 110 per 100,000 (as of 2013, in the UK it is around 1 per 100,000)
*  100 million people died in the 20th century due to the world wars
*  The 'Great Powers' fought one another almost all the time during the 1500s, leading to an inconceivable amount of destruction due to warfare (as seen in the chart below)
*  Torture was institutionalized (individuals were tortured and killed publicly for *entertainment* for even nonviolent acts such as disagreeing with the King in Medieval Europe [^1] )

A natural question that stems from these statistics is why do humans commit these acts? The reason why this is a question is because humans in the past have not only colonized/enslaved other humans for power/economic purposes, they have also savagely tortured other humans, which seems excessive from a hindsight perspective.

### Why do humans commit violent acts?

_Us vs. Them Mentality_

Humans are hard-wired to group things, and we are able to do so with incredible efficiency. Millions of years of evolution has allowed us to be able to group another human into a given category in less than 170 thousandth of a second.[^2] This "us vs. them" mentality exists everywhere today as well, from sports to caste systems and the rich versus the poor. 

There have been studies done to extensively study how the human brain groups other humans and why it does so. For example, in some studies, flashing a picture of a different race has resulted in the activation of the amygdala and less activation in the fusiform cortex. This means humans in these studies were automatically frightened of humans of a different race, and more interestingly, did not remember their faces as accurately as humans of a similar race. The hormone oxytocin can provide a clue into how exactly the brain develops this grouping. Oxytocin prompts humans to be more trusting and generous with certain members of the same group, but when it comes to people outside of the defined group, it does the opposite. Overall, the root of the "us vs. them" phenomenon is how fast the brain groups people who are "different" and how it rationalizes these differences by associating positive traits with people from the same group. 

This raises a natural question, why do we also want our own group to be better than the other group? The answer is likely multi-fold, but a clue can be found in how we view *power*. 
	
The brain is neurochemically programmed, through evolution, to seek pleasure. This is accomplished through a neurotransmitter called dopamine. There are two parts of the brain that produce dopamine. One area, called the subtantia nigra helps humans with movement and speech. The more relevant for this article is dopamine from the other region, the ventral tegmental area. This area sends dopamine into the brain when we expect or receive a reward. This dopamine tells the brain to get more of whatever it just experienced. This effectively drives the behavior of humans to continuously keep doing a certain task. 

This dopamine is what is released in large quantities when humans intake drugs, such as cocaine, nicotine, and heroin. Even though drugs may be harmful for the human in the long-term, the strength of this reward system can lead to drug addiction.[^3]

Power, which we can define as the control of resources, has material effects on the human brain. The effects of wielding power has been a topic of psychological and neurobiological research. Pamela Smith at Radbound University studied cognitive function in people by making some people temporarily powerful and others temporarily powerless. The results were interesting on both a cognitive function level and an emotional level. Firstly, both groups were made to do certain abstract tests, and the "subordinates" performed significantly worse while the individuals who were told they were in power were more creative and performed much better. On an emotional level, people who were told they were powerless had lower testosterone and higher levels of stress, indicated through cortisol, while the "superior" group had the opposite effects.[^4] This study, along with others, indicate the effects of even temporary power on the brain. Going deeper can provide us insight into how this relates to the need to make the in-group "win" versus the out-group. The primary chemical that drives power is dopamine, the neurotransmitter we mentioned earlier, which is also associated with pleasure. Considering humans continue to indulge in reward-seeking activities, driven by dopamine, a single instance of this pleasure can drive behaviors that result in the need for more power. The very act of wanting to having more power than another group could be one of the drivers of our violent acts.

Further, another reason we may view "others" as a threat is due to how the neurocircuitry of empathy works. Studies using fMRI have shown that when we are thinking about people from out-groups, neurons that are responsible for empathy and mimicry are effectively switched-off, meaning we may be hard-wired to resist emotional connections with these individuals. 

Ok, so we know why humans group "us" versus "them" and why we want to "power" over others, but why do we commit violent acts. What is the trigger between competing with "out-groups" and actually committing an act of violence versus them? Besides, sports fans can respect fans who support other teams even if they group them as "others" in their brain.

### Why are violent towards "Others"?

The human brain has a mechanism which allows it to recognize pain, and a withdrawal reflex is built-in that is defined as "the automatic withdrawal of a limb from a painful stimulus." For example, say you are watching a video of a human finger being pierced with a needle. The human nervous system is able to duplicate this experience so that it responds as if you were feeling the pain too. This "empathetic effect" was shown to be reduced when the human hand being pierced was from a different race, indicating the fact that racial bias plays a role in how empathetic we are. This could be a reason why it is easier for humans to be violent versus "others."

Another reason may have to do with how the brain perceives disgust. The insula is the part of the brain that responds to the taste or smell of something so rotten that it triggers a gag reflex and stomach lurching. From an evolutionary perspective, it probably protected our ancestors from eating poisonous or harmful foods. The following is an except from a paper published in 2015: 

"Here, we examined the neural basis of disgust perception in racial prejudice using a passive viewing task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that compared with the disgusted faces of in‐groups, the disgusted faces of out‐groups result in increased amygdala and insular engagement, positive coupling of the insula with amygdala‐based emotional system, and negative coupling of the insula with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)‐based regulatory system. Furthermore, machine‐learning algorithms revealed that the level of implicit racial prejudice could be predicted by functional couplings of the insula with both the amygdala and the ACC, which suggests that the insula is largely involved in racially biased disgust perception through two distinct neural circuits. In addition, individual difference in disgust sensitivity was found to be predictive of implicit racial prejudice. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial role of insula‐centered circuits for disgust perception in racial prejudice."

In other words, if an individual is racially prejudiced, based on the studies mentioned, they may look at other races with more "disgust." 

Overall, once the brain has grouped "us" versus "them," it develops certain associations with which leads to it feeling less empathetic and more disgust for out-group members, all of which are possible reasons why humans make the leap from simple classification of others to committing gruesome acts of violence against them. In the cavemen days, the humans who were aggressive to other humans probably survived, but in recent centuries humans have figured out a way to coexist with others. 

### Has violence decreased overtime?
If the ability to be violent to others is a fundamental human trait, it should exist at similar rates overtime, right? Interestingly, violence has decreased substantially over the past few centuries. Specifically, homicide rates were around 110 per 100,000 in 14th century Oxford and Florence, and per recent data from the UN (2018) the rate has fallen to 3 per 100,000 in Europe. Even after taking into account the possible data issues, it is clear that homicide rates were significantly higher than modern day. 

Have humans suddenly become inherently less violent? Unlikely, since evolution takes much longer to have an effect on population characteristics. Historians have theorized the following reasons: 

* The “erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion” by the “forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason, and science” contributed to the decline in rates of interpersonal violence in western societies
* Greater state intervention and a wider process of social disciplining, often driven by church bodies, new work practices, and the expansion in the number of schools have also been credited with contributing to a diminution in violent activity among individuals
* Widespread use of criminal courts to resolve disputes
* Introduction of police force
* Introduction of criminalization of violence 
* Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs


Many of these reasons are outlined in the "self-domestication hypothesis" which states that humans have "gone through a process of selection against aggression" overtime. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00134/full 

Since we have 'self-domesticated' ourselves, we use our negative emotions in ways that benefit society, this is capitalistic competition. If a group of people (a company) doesn't like another company or they want the other company's resources, they have to either acquire them or do better than them (better product for consumers), whereas in the past a group of people (country) would use war if they didn't like another country or if they wanted their resources. Our system allows us to channel the human spirit in a positive way which is a win for the person who owns the company (owns equity), the customers (new products/services), the government (collects taxes), venture capitalists (shareholders), and employees. 

This theory is used by many as a reason why humans have become less violent overtime, but does this mean that humans as a society have the potential to become "less domesticated" as well, and therefore more violent in the future? 

### Is the fate of humanity sealed?

In The Dark Knight Rises, Joker has a monologue which happens when he is being interrogated by Batman. Joker says the following to Batman: 

“Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.”

Joker may be right in the sense that if an event happens that threatens the survival of mass populations (inequality, apocalyptic event, war), most humans may go back to their animalistic roots because that is what we are "programmed to do" through evolution (to survive). The question is whether this is inevitable. The answer lies in the way humans view justice and morals. According to various studies, humans are generally motivated to strive for justice (from an early age), want other people to be treated fairly, and are driven to treat others fairly. However, humans can be exploited through messaging, and there are many experiences where humans feel empathetic towards "in-group" members and treat "others" as immoral and unjust. This also means that it may be possible to influence humans to solve a problem without violence. For example, Mahatma Gandhi led the non-violent independence movement against the British in India. He was a driving force in India's independence, but did it by conducting boycotts against British products/services and by opposing legal doctrine such as the Salt Act (which made it illegal for Indians to produce and sell salt). Through his actions, he was imprisoned twice by the British government, along with many thousands of supporters who were also imprisoned. 

Similarly, Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights movement in the United States and fought for the rights of African Americans. MLK wanted to also lead a non-violent movement, which meant doing things like travelling over 600 million miles and giving around 2500 speeches across the country. However, MLK's story also proves that it is possible for humans to unite against injustice caused by "others" without becoming violent. It is a tougher path, clearly, since both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King were assassinated, but it allows the opportunity for "others" (in this case the British and White Americans) to feel empathy for the group being persecuted.

### Implications for modern day society?
